\title{Per-Term Linear Model on Data Aligned-and-Ranked with ART-C}
\usage{
artlm.con(m, term, response = "art", factor.contrasts = "contr.sum", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{An object of class \code{\link{art}}.}

\item{term}{A character vector indicating the effect term in
the transformed data in \code{m} to use as the aligned or art response.}

\item{response}{Which response to use: the aligned (with ART-C) response
(\code{"aligned"}) or the aligned and ranked (with ART-C) response
(\code{"art"}).}

\item{factor.contrasts}{The name of the contrast-generating function to be
applied by default to fixed effect factors. Sets the the first element of
\code{\link{options}("contrasts")} for the duration of this function. The
default is to use \code{"contr.sum"}, i.e. sum-to-zero contrasts, which is
appropriate for Type III ANOVAs (the default ANOVA type for
\code{\link{anova.art}}).}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{lm}} or
\code{\link{lmer}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{lm}} if \code{formula(m)} does not
  contain grouping or error terms, an object of class \code{\link{merMod}}
  (i.e. a model fit by \code{\link{lmer}}) if it does contain grouping terms, or
  an object of class \code{aovlist} (i.e. a model fit by \code{\link{aov}})
  if it contains error terms.
}
\description{
Given an \code{\link{art}} model, build a linear model from data aligned or
aligned-and-ranked with ART-C alignment procedure by the specified term in
the model.
}
\details{
This function is used internally by \code{\link{art.con}} to construct
linear models for contrasts using the ART-C procedure (Elkin et al. 2021).
It is typically not necessary to use this function directly to conduct contrasts using
the ART-C procedure, you can use \code{\link{art.con}} instead, which will
ensure that the correct model and contrast test is run. However, should you
wish to use the ART-C procedure with a different contrast test
than provided by \code{\link{art.con}}, you may with to use this function.

Internally, the ART-C procedure concatenates the variables specified
  in \code{term}, and then removes the originals. When specifying the effect
  terms on which to conduct contrasts, use the concatenation of the effects
  specified in \code{term} instead of the original variables. This is demonstrated
  in the example below.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
data(Higgins1990Table5, package = "ARTool")

## create an art model
m <- art(DryMatter ~ Moisture*Fertilizer + (1|Tray), data=Higgins1990Table5)

## use emmeans to conduct pairwise contrasts on "Moisture"
library(emmeans)
contrast(emmeans(artlm.con(m, "Moisture"), ~ Moisture), method = "pairwise")

## use emmeans to conduct pairwise contrasts on "Moisture:Fertilizer"
## N.B. internally, artlm.con concatenates the factors Moisture and Fertilizer
## to create MoistureFertilizer. If you try to use any of Moisture, Fertilizer,
## Moisture:Fertilizer, or Moisture*Fertilizer in the RHS of the formula
## passed to emmeans, you will get an error because the factors Moisture and Fertilizer
## do not exist in the model returned by artlm.con.
contrast(emmeans(artlm.con(m, "Moisture:Fertilizer"), ~ MoistureFertilizer), method = "pairwise")

## Note: art.con uses emmeans internally, and the above examples are equivalent to
## the following calls to art.con, which is the recommended approach as it will
## ensure the model selected and the contrasts extracted from emmeans match.
art.con(m, "Moisture")
art.con(m, "Moisture:Fertilizer")
