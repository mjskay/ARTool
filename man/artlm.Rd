\title{Per-Term Linear Model from Aligned Rank Transformed Data}
\usage{
artlm(
  m,
  term,
  response = c("art", "aligned"),
  factor.contrasts = "contr.sum",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{An object of class \code{\link{art}}.}

\item{term}{A character vector indicating the effect term
in the transformed data in \code{m} to use as the aligned or art response.}

\item{response}{Which response to use: the aligned response
(\code{"aligned"}) or the aligned and ranked (\code{"art"}) response.}

\item{factor.contrasts}{The name of the contrast-generating function to be
applied by default to fixed effect factors. Sets the the first element of
\code{\link{options}("contrasts")} for the duration of this function. The
default is to use \code{"contr.sum"}, i.e. sum-to-zero contrasts, which is
appropriate for Type III ANOVAs (the default ANOVA type for
\code{\link{anova.art}}).}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{lm}} or
\code{\link[lme4]{lmer}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{lm}} if \code{formula(m)} does not
contain grouping or error terms, an object of class \code{\link[lme4]{merMod}}
(i.e. a model fit by \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}}) if it contains grouping terms, or
an object of class \code{aovlist} (i.e. a model fit by \code{\link{aov}}) if
it contains error terms.
}
\description{
Build a linear model for ART data with response aligned or aligned and
ranked by the specified term from the model.
}
\details{
This function is used primarily for post-hoc tests. To run an ANOVA, it does
not need to be called directly; instead, use \code{\link{anova.art}}, which
calls this function as needed.
}
\seealso{
See \code{\link{art}} for an example. See also
\code{\link{anova.art}}, which makes use of this function.
